Submitted by: **Miranda Casan**

This web app: **Discover dogs around the world! Using the Dog API, now you can find the dog with specific characterics and learn about the different temperaments that dogs can have. Try out this app!**

## Notes

My main challenge, was about the restrictions with weight, if you notice there is a problem when it comes to put a specific range for lbs in the ban list.
